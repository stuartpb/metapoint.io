    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <p>It's basically just like a wiki for tracking different pages for the same thing across different sites.<p>
    <h1>How does it work?</h1>
    <p>I'm in a bit of a rush at the moment- check out the form on <a href="suggest.html">the suggestion page</a> for the current use of the suggestion API. (The idea is, you have one topic, and then each URL is the page for that topic on its site, ie. the Wikipedia, IMDB, Netflix, and Hulu pages.)</p>
